* Like your favourite (Optional)
* See your favourites (Optional)

We would like you to try and present a well written solution that will cover the above criteria. Utilising the following points
* Python 3.*
* Django (_Current repo uses a django template. Feel free to restructure if your solution is based on anything else like flask/fast api etc_)
* Database integration (Postgres or any equivalent)
* Docker
* Testing suite
* README

Get creative as much as you want, we WILL appreciate it. You will not be evaluated based on how well you follow these instructions, but based on how sensible your solution will be. In case you are not able to implement something you would normally implement for time reasons, make it clear with a comment.
